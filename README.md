# E-Pehchaan, A step to digitalise India

# Problem Statement:
Carrying hardcopies of legal documents like Driving License, Registration Certificate(RC), important papers of property and many more, is quite a difficult task. There is lot of risk of losing it anywhere and falling into big problems that will cost a lot of time and money.

# Our solution:
We created a web portal where the user can request for the Digital ID from its corresponding Agency/Organisation like e-Driving License, e-RC and all this information will be stored in the blockchain. When the user requests for a e-DL, firstly he will be verified by sending an OTP to his mobile. Then, organisation will verify the userâ€™s database. If proved to be correct, the user will be get a certified Digital Driving license. This e-DL is verified by a valid, unique QR code generated by the machine.

This will benefit both: the users and the Government. At user end: they no longer need to carry the hardcopy everywhere, so lesser worries. At Agency/Organisation/Government end: they will have Blockchain, where each block represents one person, and it consists all the info. about that person i.e., all the info. related to aadhar, driving license. Also, the govt. will not need to do much work as before in those cases where they deal with persons with fraud/fake ID proofs. Also, hacking such a large blockchain will cost lot of time and money.
